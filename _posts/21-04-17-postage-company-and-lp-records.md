As a fellow metal head, I'm quite materialistic and want to have all the records/tapes/cd's I can get my hands on from my favourite or, emerging underground bands. There are some people who just love the idea of digital music, the fact that it's _easily accessible_, and _convenient_ - For the most part, streaming music can be good for on-the-go, but I prefer taking my Sony Walkman with me. That's not to say my iPhone doesn't contain my music too, I only really use my iPhone for music if I forget my Walkman --I digress.

Recently I've gone on a spending spree and buying a whole bunch of LP's from my favourite bands like, Motorhead, Burzum, Nargaroth and a few underground bandcamp bands. Needless to say people package the LP's pretty darn well, bubble-wrapped, extra sleeve casing, hardback envelopes, you name it, it's keeping my precious LP's in an unbreakable condition once it gets to my house. 

One thing that seems to always happen is that as soon as I get the postman deliver my record, there's always some form of tattiness on the package, or some creases that may indicate it may have been bent. I mean who cares about the **Do Not Bend!** or **Fragile**, right? RIGHT?! You'll probably see where this is going now...

My gripe with record collecting is the postal companies being so reckless with your packages, but that's not to say that other orders of mine have come in perfect condition, because I can assure you that's not the case! It's just with records, they cost quite a bit, despite their revival recently. We're talking about £20/30 here, and that may not always mean it's new. I was lucky enough to get Burzum's self-titled album for £20, considering that thing goes for well over £100, it's no wonder why I'm so whiney about delivery of LP's being rubbish.

I sincerely think that postmen or companies just know that they're LP's so they purpose troll you and do all sorts, it almost reminds me of my Drum teacher and his infamous Cymbal he received through the post. Needless to say there was a massive crack through it that forever ruined the sound of it, and he wasn't happy at all. A £200 cymbal (by the sounds of it) sounding like a £0.50 pile of scrap - yeap, _wasn't happy at all_ is an understatment!

Luckily my LP's are in good shape and haven't got crazy scratches on them, but I think my lesson for today and for a long time to come is just avoid buying LP's online unless I need to. I only recently found that we have a record shop in Luton town, that's not HMV who charge like £40 for a Metallica Black Album LP! Now if you excuse me I now need to blast the house down with some Motorhead!

Thanks for reading!
