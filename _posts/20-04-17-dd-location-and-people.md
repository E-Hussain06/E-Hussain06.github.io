If you know me well, then you'll probably know that I am infact a huge table-top roleplaying game fan. That means I play the likes of Dungeons and Dragons (Including AD&D, B/X D&D) and Mythic-Fantasy Roleplaying Game. You may also know that I am a DM/GM/MM whatever you want to call me (the referee?), which in turn means I'm hosting each and every game session. I write the campaign, the monster pop-ups, drawing out the maps, and trying to kill the whole-party (well not really, I'm not that mean) for every game! So you may already know that being a DM is quite the work.

I've not been playing for so long, in fact I started my hobby last September, but I'm so heavily addicting to Roleplaying that it's becoming a thing I need to do almost daily now --well I'm not that too hung up on it! As time has gone on I've evolved from a Player to know hosting my games. It takes a lot of work to build games _(refer to the first paragraph for an outline of my work)_!

After playing for a while I've noticed so many beginner players have recently signed up to play some D&D or MYFAROG and just don't jump feet first into the water, that is a game. Roleplaying games, albeit Table-Top, can be played online or in person. My own problem is that I don't have the space to fit 5 people on my dinner table to play, or know anyone who is going to be commited to play it on a regular-basis. I've compromised and play with my younger brother (He's just started last week), but most of my games are online with community members or my friends via Google Hangouts.

Had I been in the US, I would probably find a club or some place to just sit down with my friends in person, and slay some Dragons. Now it does seem like I'm whining but if you decided to play D&D, you'll have some insane ideas for an adventure, then you'll see why I'm writing all of this - We need more local players, albeit, we need more players! Especially in the MYFAROG community, where there are so many people hosting but not enough people playing. I understand that things do happen and stop you from playing but I've heard a lot of excuses out of the book already.

As a Lutonian, we definitely need more clubs or locally accessible places where people can just play Table-top games like D&D, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic: The Gathering, and various other games. If there's a downside to the table-top hobby of mine, it's definitely finding people to play with and location. Since I live in a small house, and it can be cramped it definitely doesn't help with the whole situation of location. I'm sure there can be some compromises that we can take, but I don't think it'd have the same feeling if we were all at the table.

Luckily I've recently stumbled across a group on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/164156360297438/) that is an actual club for table-top gamers like me, so I'll definitely check it out and get the community growing. Though it's full of Warhammer gamers, which I'm not too fond of or haven't really played, it's still something. 

For those who are like me and have so many ideas but cannot really play with local friends, then try online gamers - there are thousands of simulators for the table-top hobby, and even a lot more people who want to play. But if you're like me who's adamant about playing with a set group of people/friends, then find yourself a club.

Not enough players or not having enough players, and Location, are definitely my only gripe I have for this hobby of mine, but once you get over this, it's so fun!

Happy gaming and keep rolling those D20's!
