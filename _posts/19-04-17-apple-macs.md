title: "Apple Macs"

Within the last two days my ol' reliable of a HP Laptop that's running Windows OS, is finally dying on me. I've had it about for perhaps 3 years coming onto 4 years; it's safe to say that's time to move onto a new laptop. Blue screens are a Windows-user worst nightmare!

I hear so many good things about Apple Macs, and most developers I know of are currently using Macs; albeit a UNIX-based machine. I've had my fair share of use with most common PC platforms like Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10, Linux (Fedora/Debian/Ubuntu/Kali), and Mac OS (OSX and later). All of them have their uses, but since I'm more of a CLI user, Linux and dare I say it, Macs are something I should be aiming for.

That said, I'm really looking forward to getting a Mac sometime soon. If you're wondering what Macs are good for in terms of development, then here are a few reaons. I'm not exactly an advocate for Apple but I've never really had a problem with Apple products besides a smashed iPhone screen (but haven't we all?).

* Macs are UNIX-based and therefore will have UNIX technology and functionality under the hood!

* The Terminal you learn from in Mac OS can be applied to the Linux Terminal!

* With Virtualisation being a thing, you can also run Windows OS/Linux OS without degrading so much of your resources! If you were to try that with Windows, you'd see so many problems trying to create a Hackintosh

* Macs tend to support decent processors and RAM specs, with this I'm sure you're able to run lots of crap in the background!

* The I/O subsystem is actually good, considering the flash in Macs, these machines run especially well!

* Keyboards can stand a lot of abuse, trackpads are actually usable unlike HP trackpads! The retina/LCD screens actually utilise the whole surface area of the screen-lid, unlike other laptops that have 6 inches of casing and compromising resolution.

* Although I'm more of a wired guy, and don't mind wires, it also is good that Macs have great wireless, especially since we devs use our machines for perhaps 10 hours a day (maybe even more) this means everything!

* Gestures are a thing with devices like the iPhone, Samsung S-series, Virtual Reality and so forth. Macs have better gestures which does help making things easier. If you're so used to pinch-zooming, two-finger sliding or just showing off cool gestures, then Macs will cater for this! 

No dissrespect to Windows, but the only good use I see now is for Gaming - one of the things I'll stay away from any Apple Macs. My main gripe with Windows is how often my Explorer will constantly crash when utilising my CPU and RAM to it's bottleneck. I've gone through many HDD's and found a pattern in when things go pear-shaped. I'm quite good with the Anti-viruses and Malware removal which isn't a problem, but found that unless you're using SSD's you're going to have a hard time in the short-run. 

I've owned a good bunch of Windows laptops and each and every one of them has either had a rubbish Toshiba HDD which dies every month, overheated despite giving great ventilation. Any other complaints would just be from the OS itself!

I cannot stand Command Prompt at all, it's got to the point where I've installed Git Bash so I can use my Unix commands on Windows without seeing every undefined 'ls' every minute, it's annoying. As a developer, I cannot seem to get through the day in peace without having something to complain about the OS. Whether it be that my explorer has crashed, my CPU is spiking for an unknown reason, or that there are updates every single second.

With all due respect Windows, you've been good to me but it's time to change!

Thanks for reading!
