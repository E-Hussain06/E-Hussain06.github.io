title: "Keeping Routine"
---

With so many things happening in life, routines can break. I've had an awesome introduction to the family of a new baby kitten, we've named him, Yoshi. It's been about a week or so since we've had him and my routine that I've worked on for so long has diminished.

It can be very over-whelmning with so many things happening, losing sleep, coding a Web app, looking after a new pet (considering I'm a first pet owner), and looking for new jobs. Even my Gym routine has been crazy with this. 

Take a deep breath!

It can be quite annoying but writing your schedule out for the day, especially as a Freelance developer, is the best way to go about doing so. Stick to that routine and eventually you'll get back on track. There are times where you can just feel like in Limbo, but as a developer there's always something to be doing.


Thanks for reading this small post!
