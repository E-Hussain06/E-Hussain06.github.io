As a fairly-new person into the Table-top RPG hobby, Mythic-Fantasy Roleplaying Game, _aka MYFAROG_, was my first RPG I picked up and may I say I loved it to bits.

I'm apart of a group on Facebook that holds game-events for this game, needless to say it's full of beginners. Though there are some seasoned players, including myself, I think there's no real basis of how to actually play the game. Varg, _the author_, did a very good job in balancing his time out and made some MYFAROG videos, however they seem more towards older versions of the game.

I've decided to start creating a site, and it's sole purpose will be to assist the beginners and help them get into games fairly easier.

Once I've got something up, I will update it here!

Thanks for reading.
