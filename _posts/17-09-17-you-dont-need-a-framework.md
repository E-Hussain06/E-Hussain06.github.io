# You don't need a Framework

Responsive web design is one of those approaches to creating websites which layout basically adapts to fit the device's viewport/screen resolution - despite if it's a tablet, phone, desktop, or even a TV!

Sounds a bit scary - Good thing we have CSS/JavaScript and even HTML frameworks, e.g. Bootstrap, Foundation, KendoUI, to figure all this out for us. Well maybe...

Don't get me wrong, I think frameworks are fantastic additions to projects and tools that increase development while solving some common problems (i.e. Clear-fix, grid-layouts), but to me I think there's a cost of a little creativity. If you do happen to use them, then there's no real-problem. 

However if you're having trouble trying to put together a response site without the aid of a framework, I think you should definitely consider learning how to. It's really important as a developer to know what's going under the hood. I mean if you don't really care that much about it, then I suppose you won't grow as much as a developer like you think you will.

**What I've learnt from this all:** By the end of it all, it's really not scary at all. After some research and having a go myself, I like to consider the mot important aspects when building these sort of sites:

* __Foundation__ - load-bearing code
* __Breakpoints__ - at what point will the content collapse or respond
* __Structure__ - a simple grid system, in short
* __Navigation__ - collapsible navigation

The likely reality is that you need even need a fraction of what the framworks come with. You may recall that the documentation for these frameworks can be quite massive. If you're an experienced developer, you may know how to grab the parts you want and integreate with the likes of SASS, SCSS or, LESS. However the average developer or even junior, may just simply include the vanilla plain CSS and JS files, and then overriding them in separate files.

There is a high-level of satisfaction that comes when you've truly created something from scratch, having a really deep understanding of how your code works and even knowing how to manipulate it.

Which is what I'm primarily focussing on so that my understanding for under-the-hood is more stable - anyone can really use a framework with a basic understanding but it takes more understanding/brain-power to know what everything does, and how to best use certain parts.

Thanks for reading!
