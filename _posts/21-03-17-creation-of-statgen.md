title: "Creation of Statgen"
---
The creation of Statgen started a while back when I came across Jekyll, which is a `Ruby` based SSG. So I decided to look around on `Node` for any JavaScript-based alternatives but unfortunately, I didn't find anything that particularly stood out.

I then proceeded to make it a project to set myself to build a `Node JS`/`JavaScript` SSG that's directly inspired by `Jekyll`, and then publish it to `npm`. I teamed up with my close friend, Shahid Altaf and we got working! You can follow him on his GitHub [here](https://github.com/shahidaltaf).

After testing it all, we were happy it was stable, ready to be published to `npm`, we both called it [Statgen](https://www.npmjs.org/package/statgen). You can find the source code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ehsanh06/statgen).
