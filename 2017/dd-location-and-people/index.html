    <h1>D&amp;D: Location and People</h1>
    <p>If you know me well, then you&#39;ll probably know that I am infact a huge table-top roleplaying game fan. That means I play the likes of Dungeons and Dragons (Including AD&amp;D, B/X D&amp;D) and Mythic-Fantasy Roleplaying Game. You may also know that I am a DM/GM/MM whatever you want to call me (the referee?), which in turn means I&#39;m hosting each and every game session. I write the campaign, the monster pop-ups, drawing out the maps, and trying to kill the whole-party (well not really, I&#39;m not that mean) for every game! So you may already know that being a DM is quite the work.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not been playing for so long, in fact I started my hobby last September, but I&#39;m so heavily addicting to Roleplaying that it&#39;s becoming a thing I need to do almost daily now --well I&#39;m not that too hung up on it! As time has gone on I&#39;ve evolved from a Player to know hosting my games. It takes a lot of work to build games <em>(refer to the first paragraph for an outline of my work)</em>!</p>
<p><img alt='Perception check meme' src='/_assets/img/perception-check.jpg' style='position:relative; right:-15em;'/></p>
<p>After playing for a while I&#39;ve noticed so many beginner players have recently signed up to play some D&amp;D or MYFAROG and just don&#39;t jump feet first into the water, that is a game. Roleplaying games, albeit Table-Top, can be played online or in person. My own problem is that I don&#39;t have the space to fit 5 people on my dinner table to play, or know anyone who is going to be commited to play it on a regular-basis. I&#39;ve compromised and play with my younger brother (He&#39;s just started last week), but most of my games are online with community members or my friends via Google Hangouts.</p>
<p>Had I been in the US, I would probably find a club or some place to just sit down with my friends in person, and slay some Dragons. Now it does seem like I&#39;m whining but if you decided to play D&amp;D, you&#39;ll have some insane ideas for an adventure, then you&#39;ll see why I&#39;m writing all of this - We need more local players, albeit, we need more players! Especially in the MYFAROG community, where there are so many people hosting but not enough people playing. I understand that things do happen and stop you from playing but I&#39;ve heard a lot of excuses out of the book already.</p>
<p>As a Lutonian, we definitely need more clubs or locally accessible places where people can just play Table-top games like D&amp;D, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic: The Gathering, and various other games. If there&#39;s a downside to the table-top hobby of mine, it&#39;s definitely finding people to play with and location. Since I live in a small house, and it can be cramped it definitely doesn&#39;t help with the whole situation of location. I&#39;m sure there can be some compromises that we can take, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;d have the same feeling if we were all at the table.</p>
<p>Luckily I&#39;ve recently stumbled across a group on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/164156360297438/">Facebook</a> that is an actual club for table-top gamers like me, so I&#39;ll definitely check it out and get the community growing. Though it&#39;s full of Warhammer gamers, which I&#39;m not too fond of or haven&#39;t really played, it&#39;s still something. </p>
<p>For those who are like me and have so many ideas but cannot really play with local friends, then try online gamers - there are thousands of simulators for the table-top hobby, and even a lot more people who want to play. But if you&#39;re like me who&#39;s adamant about playing with a set group of people/friends, then find yourself a club.</p>
<p>Not enough players or not having enough players, and Location, are definitely my only gripe I have for this hobby of mine, but once you get over this, it&#39;s so fun!</p>
<p>Happy gaming and keep rolling those D20&#39;s!</p>
