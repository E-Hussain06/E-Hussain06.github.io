<p>A recent Twitter poll has shown that 54% of people said they spend 3+ hours preparing for each session. That’s as much time preparing as most people spend at the actual gaming table!</p>
<p>Do you feel like that’s way too much time? That&#39;d be quite a subjective answer.</p>
<p>Now I’m not knocking prepared DMs (prepared DMs are the best DMs). Some people certainly like the solitary work that goes into preparing a perfect game session. Whether it be just outlining the situation, or just thinking of a really intense encounter.</p>
<p>But it’s easy to get burned out creating extensive campaign worlds, crafting tons of 3D scenery, picking out just the right miniatures, crafting background lore, whipping up NPCs and selecting (or modifying) monsters. I know from first hand experience when my players thwarted my plans and everything went pear-shaped!</p>
<p>I digress - Here are some of my top 10 DM tips to help you speed up your D&amp;D prep!</p>
<p><strong>Do more at the start of your campaign.</strong> </p>
<p>For me at least, I like to front-load the preparation of my campaign(s) before the first session. I figure out random encounter tables and the maps and miniatures (if I&#39;ve got miniatures available) I might need for those. I figure out the monsters I’m going to need of the first several sessions and do the same. I get maps ready and photocopy pages from the <em>Monster Manual</em> to put in my binder. Basically, I get a ton ready before the campaign even starts, so I’m not having to prepare those items before every session.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t do too much.</strong> </p>
<p>There&#39;s no real need to be having infinite tables for every journey, rules for every encounter or endless consequences for every decision. You’re not writing a novel, you’re preparing for a game. There’s also a tendency as a DM to want to push players toward whatever it is that you prepared, especially if you prepared a lot. I&#39;m quite an advocate for doing this and I&#39;ve learnt that it doesn&#39;t go accordingly; players care little about your plans anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Limit the players’ options.</strong></p>
<p>Have you asked an indecisive friend/family/significant other what they&#39;d like to eat? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll know that you have to give them an either/or option instead of a menu, since they options are overwhelming. Players can be the same way, and you’ll help yourself by limiting their options a tiny bit - I’m not talking about steamlining or railroading. You can decide the PCs make it to the next locale without having to roll for an encounter and you can decide what encounters are available to them. In short, you can keep things on a rail without railroading.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to improv.</strong> </p>
<p>Too many people see the word “improv” and think it means creating a campaign out of whole cloth in front of your players. This is definitely not so! It just means thinking of something else for them to do when they go off the rails, and that can be as simple as picking another location in your game world; From having an NPC approach them, or running into a pack of monsters. One thing I love about the Red Dragon 5E DM Screen is that there is an event table, if you&#39;re in a pinch. </p>
<p><strong>Keep some random tables in your back pocket.</strong> </p>
<p>I like to have an idea of the possibilities of where my players might go and prep those possibilities (locations, dungeons, monsters, NPCs, etc); whilst it&#39;s quite hard to cover everything, I want to try and cover most turfs. But since D&amp;D is often so open, the players could go do whatever they can think of. Having a few random tables would help you come up with something on the fly rather than trying to prep for every eventuality. </p>
<p>Go-tos: Random travel encounters (a few monsters, a few NPCs, a few events), Random locations (a tavern, a house, a temple, etc.) and Random monsters (based on the terrain or area they’re in). That way, if the players depart from where you thought they’d go, you could say they run into a <em>D20 Roll</em> merchant with a broken down cart next to a <em>D20 Roll</em> ruined temple infested with <em>D20 Roll</em> basilisks.</p>
<p><strong>Use published adventures.</strong></p>
<p>Creating your own campaign is really fun and it’s exciting for players too! But if you just want to run a fun game without so much on your shoulders, pick up a hardcover adventure book or string together several separate modules. I&#39;m currently doing this for my local group of friends because I just don&#39;t have the time to build a massive world for them right now - I&#39;m running <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Dungeons-Dragons-Tyranny-Rise-Tiamat-Wizards-Coast/0786965657">Rise of Tiamat</a>. Some people even use Pathfinder’s Adventure Paths because they are great long-running campaigns, and D&amp;D’s 5e books have something for whatever you’re into. (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Curse-Strahd-Dungeons-Sourcebook-Supplement/dp/0786965983/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502223924&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=curse+of+strahd">Strahd</a> is a horror adventure, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Storm-Kings-Thunder-Dungeons-Dragons/dp/0786966009/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502223939&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Storm+of+the+King%27s+thunder">Storm King’s Thunder</a> is a great dungeon-delving, giant fighting adventure, and Hoard of the Dragon Queen is a great dragon-slaying good time.)</p>
<p><strong>Keep things simple.</strong> </p>
<p>Although going against some of the above tips - You don’t need to plan for every eventuality! You don’t need eight pages of lore for each NPC. Keep things limited to what you think or know the PCs will get into. If they’re headed to a magical library to talk to a wizard before going down into some haunted catacombs, get the wizard’s stats, his possible answers, the map and monsters for the catacombs. That’s it! You don’t need titles of the books in the library or a detailed description of the path through the city to the catacombs. Unless if you know it&#39;s what players want to know, then do so.</p>
<p><strong>Rely on your source books.</strong> </p>
<p>Is it easier to craft an NPC from a clean slate or, just grab an appropriate one from the back of the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Monster-Manual-Dungeons-Rulebook-Rulebooks/dp/0786965614">Monster Manual</a> and change a stat or two? Do what you can to use the materials you have in front of you rather than starting everything from scratch. Of course more power to you if you want to go down that road, but source books give you a better guideline. I also like to make notes on where to find particular monsters or spells (book name and page number) and use post-its placed inside my books like tabs to be able to flip there quickly. Some people go ahead and write on the paper, again more power to you if you want to go down that road.</p>
<p><strong>Use index cards.</strong> </p>
<p>One easy way to speed things up (and keep things organized at the table too) is to write out ideas and notes on index cards. Quick notes on monster HP, AC and attacks, NPC details, location information and lots of other stuff can be put in simple terms on index cards. Then at the table, you can lay them out in front of you or on your DM Screen. Use them when you need to, worst case scenario that you didn&#39;t use it, save it for later!</p>
<p><strong>Use a laptop.</strong> </p>
<p>Instead of using index cards you can use a laptop, tablet or even your smart phone. I hadn’t thought about it before, but <a href="https://geekdad.com/2016/02/easy-dungeon-master-preparation/">GeekDad laid out a system he uses on Trello</a>, a free online whiteboard. I use Trello to organize work stuff, but his system for D&amp;D notes is both efficient and simple.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you and thanks for reading!</p>
