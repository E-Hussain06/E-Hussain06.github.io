    <h1>Perseverance</h1>
    <p>This post is about <strong>Perseverance</strong> and mainly aimed for the developers who are having a tough time.</p>
<p>Back when I was in College in 2011, I didn&#39;t know exactly what I wanted to do with my life. I had silly inspirations in becoming
a barrister just for the sheer reason of dealing with criminal cases. Needless to say, it didn&#39;t go exactly the way I would have
liked it to.</p>
<p>At this point in my life relative to any form of developing or technical knowledge, I was decent at Flash Animation, building very simple sites using <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and <code>JavaScript</code>/<code>jQuery</code>. My knowledge was very new and fresh, but with the right advice and direction I would soon to be building <code>npm</code> modules like <a href="https://github.com/ehsanh06/statgen">Statgen</a>.</p>
<p>How I got to this point in my developing career (though I&#39;m still slightly fresh) is by self-teaching myself all I knew. I had the opportunity to University, but I declined. I knew that I would be able to learn everything myself in good time before 4 years were up; to me it would have seemed a little waste. I started by signing up to <a href="https://codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> and went through their free online lessons for <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and <code>JavaScript</code> until I knew what was what. I wasn&#39;t worried about what sort of Web Developer I would be just yet, I at least wanted my basics down first. So to those who are just starting out, just start with what I did first.</p>
<p>Now that I knew what was going on, I then started looking at other Web Developer languages like <code>SQL</code>, <code>PHP</code>, <code>Python</code>, and took their crash course on <a href="https://codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> to see what else was out there. I did enjoy Python, so jotted it down on my backlog as a developer to learn in the later future, but for the moment,  I was already taken with <code>JavaScript</code> and wanted to become a JavaScript developer. Obviously there is the whole Front-End/Back-End/Full-Stack routes, so in this instance I would realistically be classed as a Front-End JavaScript Developer; and only for arguement sake. By this time, I had taken up an apprenticeship, made redundant, completed my apprenticeship, then made redundant. But despite what was going upstairs, I still pushed through.</p>
<p>So what&#39;s next? Now we go down the JavaScript route and I found myself many Frameworks to choose from. At this point it was a constant battle of what&#39;s better for me as a JavaScript developer. After doing my own precedented searches, and some advice from a good few developers. Though at this time my mental state was never that good, and it&#39;s the only thing that really held me back from absolutely anything. Just to give you an idea how long this has taken, it is about 3 years after College; in theory is contradicting the whole University thing, but I&#39;m standing by not going to University. If anything I&#39;d be just for the experience rather than really getting the degree - although a bad intention, it&#39;s the way I&#39;d see it --I digress.</p>
<p>From all this I then handpicked what I was going to specialise in, <code>Node JS</code>, and <code>Angular JS</code>. I&#39;ve subscribed to many blogs, following a lot of developers on Twitter, and keeping up with best practices with not just <code>JavaScript</code> frameworks but, also <code>HTML</code> and <code>CSS</code>; they&#39;re also the basis for Front-End Developing too, it&#39;s always best to have a good foundation. In the process, me and my good friend [Shahid Altaf] (<a href="https://github.com/shahidaltaf">https://github.com/shahidaltaf</a>) decided on a plan to kickstart my career in full motion with goals in mind and structure --key words here. So we have been going about with it for about just under 6 months, and unless you&#39;ve not been following but we&#39;ve published the new SSG, <a href="https://npmjs.org/statgen">Statgen</a>.</p>
<p>_You just rambled on about your progress in your developing career, what&#39;s the point?_My point is that despite your background, if you want to persue Developing or any kind of career, get goals in, and go for broke. You have only one life, so spend it by doing things you love doing! Get savvy with your career path, have passion, and forget how long it&#39;ll take you. Slow progression is still progression; it&#39;s just like pumping the guns at the Gym, you don&#39;t get it just overnight --It takes time for the muscle to become more prominent. Build structure to your life, stop at nothing to get your ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
