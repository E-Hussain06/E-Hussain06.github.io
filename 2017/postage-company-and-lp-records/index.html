    <h1>Postage Company and LP records</h1>
    <p>As a fellow metal head, I&#39;m quite materialistic and want to have all the records/tapes/cd&#39;s I can get my hands on from my favourite or, emerging underground bands. There are some people who just love the idea of digital music, the fact that it&#39;s <em>easily accessible</em>, and <em>convenient</em> - For the most part, streaming music can be good for on-the-go, but I prefer taking my Sony Walkman with me. That&#39;s not to say my iPhone doesn&#39;t contain my music too, I only really use my iPhone for music if I forget my Walkman --I digress.</p>
<p>Recently I&#39;ve gone on a spending spree and buying a whole bunch of LP&#39;s from my favourite bands like, Motorhead, Burzum, Nargaroth and a few underground bandcamp bands. Needless to say people package the LP&#39;s pretty darn well, bubble-wrapped, extra sleeve casing, hardback envelopes, you name it, it&#39;s keeping my precious LP&#39;s in an unbreakable condition once it gets to my house. </p>
<p>One thing that seems to always happen is that as soon as I get the postman deliver my record, there&#39;s always some form of tattiness on the package, or some creases that may indicate it may have been bent. I mean who cares about the <strong>Do Not Bend!</strong> or <strong>Fragile</strong>, right? RIGHT?! You&#39;ll probably see where this is going now...</p>
<p>My gripe with record collecting is the postal companies being so reckless with your packages, but that&#39;s not to say that other orders of mine have come in perfect condition, because I can assure you that&#39;s not the case! It&#39;s just with records, they cost quite a bit, despite their revival recently. We&#39;re talking about £20/30 here, and that may not always mean it&#39;s new. I was lucky enough to get Burzum&#39;s self-titled album for £20, considering that thing goes for well over £100, it&#39;s no wonder why I&#39;m so whiney about delivery of LP&#39;s being rubbish.</p>
<p>I sincerely think that postmen or companies just know that they&#39;re LP&#39;s so they purpose troll you and do all sorts, it almost reminds me of my Drum teacher and his infamous Cymbal he received through the post. Needless to say there was a massive crack through it that forever ruined the sound of it, and he wasn&#39;t happy at all. A £200 cymbal (by the sounds of it) sounding like a £0.50 pile of scrap - yeap, <em>wasn&#39;t happy at all</em> is an understatment!</p>
<p>Luckily my LP&#39;s are in good shape and haven&#39;t got crazy scratches on them, but I think my lesson for today and for a long time to come is just avoid buying LP&#39;s online unless I need to. I only recently found that we have a record shop in Luton town, that&#39;s not HMV who charge like £40 for a Metallica Black Album LP! Now if you excuse me I now need to blast the house down with some Motorhead!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
