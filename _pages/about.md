My name is Ehsan Hussain, I'm a freelance Front-End developer. This is where I'll be sharing some of my tips,
thoughts and opinions on my **developing** and **life** journeys.

I've been programming for a while, mainly in web. I've been focussed mostly on JavaScript and web app development, using NodeJS, Angular2 and MongoDB. With a great cup of black coffee and Motorhead blasting in my Headphones, I'm all set for programming.

Besides my love for development I also am a huge table-top and video gamer - If I'm not coding I'm either slaying Chromium Dragons in a session of D&D or I'm hunting a handful of Zinogre's in a session of Monster Hunter.

Beyond my love for tech and gaming, I do balance it out with some strength training at the gym. As much as I love to game it's also important that I keep in-shape, mentally challenged by code and physically challenged by the heavier weights.
