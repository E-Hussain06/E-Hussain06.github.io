I've been currently focussing on the following:

* Honing my skills in front-end and back-end languages
* Looking for new opportunities to help me advance my career
* Building new understanding of new coding practices and concepts
* Developing a music project specialising in the Nordic Metal sub-genre
* Slaying Dragons as a part-time Half-Elf Warlock

This page is inspired by the [Derik Sivers now page](https://sivers.org/now).
