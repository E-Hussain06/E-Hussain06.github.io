Right now I'm currently working on some small *ReactJS / Redux* projects using some online courses to help build my knowledge and skills on some more front-end technologies. I may write about my experience using *React/Redux* some day but for the moment I'm just getting my feet wet. I've completed a neat project using *Spotify's API* on my GitHub which I felt was a nice introduction to *ReactJS*.

Whilst I'm doing that and just making sure my fundamentals are intact, I'm also actively searching for new opportunities for Front-End jobs. 

Hobby-wise, I've been working on a new campaign for my new *Dungeons and Dragons* party, so I've purchased a few books and have been preparing or my sessions since. I decided to make my Half-Elf into a Human Warlock, it's a lot more interesting this way! My party beware, I've some interesting things setup for you!

Anything else I'm working on, I'll add it right here.
